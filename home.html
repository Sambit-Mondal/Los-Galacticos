                <h3>The Name on the front is more important than the one on the back</h3>

                    important as

                    also as a

                    person. So come, witness the uprise of our crew to one of the finests in India to one of
                    the
                    powerhouses
                    in the world, and last but not the least, enjoy your stay here.</p>


                <p>Sports allow people to learn teamwork and experience succeed-or-fail situations in a safe
                    environment. With each failure comes a lesson, and with every success comes confidence. In addition
                    to healthy physical activity sports provide athletes opportunities to learn life lessons and what it
                    means to be part of something greater than themselves. Through sports, your child will not only
                    learn about teamwork, they will learn the skills necessary to foster it.</p>

                <h3>Faith:</h3>
                <p>Faith enables each name in the team to heavily depend on one another, as well as good teamwork that
                    depends on trust. In any sports team, all of the names need to be trusting with each other. When
                    there
                    is no trust and the members play solely, the whole team is weakened.</p>

                <h3>Enthusiasm:</h3>
                <p> It connects the entire team together. Many participants contribute in sports for enjoyment and fun.
                    If
                    there is fun, the members will become enthusiastic. Therefore, the whole team should share
                    enthusiasm
                    that stems from the desire to win as a team.</p>

                <h3>Ambition:</h3>
                <p>Ambition creates the commitment of having the ability to realize these goals. Individuals, no doubt,
                    need ambition in order to be consistent in attending troublesome coaching sessions, as well as in
                    focusing on the improvement of skills for the benefit of both the individuals, and also the team.
                </p>

                <h3>Motivation:</h3>
                <p class="end">Motivation might be a silent feeling that drives a team to ultimately accomplish their
                    goal of winning.
                    An individual name that has good motivation will make a team do things that are quite not
                    possible.
                    Teams feel challenge when they know that they are able to win their match. It is challenging,
                    knowing
                    that there is a chance to win. That motivation can enable you to be assured and play the game
                    calmly,
                    and with the faith that it will end up well.</p>
